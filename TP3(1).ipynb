        "\n",
        "The use of graph is a way to structure data by adding neighborhood information between features. This then allows to do operations on the data that are local to each node and its neighbors. This is the main idea behind Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). [`pytorch-geometric`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a library compatible with PyTorch that allows to easily implement GNNs. The most general structure is the [`MessagePassing`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.MessagePassing.html#torch_geometric.nn.conv.MessagePassing) class that is then used as a base for more specific GNNs as seen in the course ([Graph Convolutional Networks](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.GCNConv.html#torch_geometric.nn.conv.GCNConv) or [Graph AttenTion Convolution](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.GATConv.html#torch_geometric.nn.conv.GATConv)).\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, you already know an operation that uses the structure of the data to do local operations: the convolution (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html). One can see the convolution as a specific case of the message passing neural network. The goal of this notebook is to show how to use the `MessagePassing` class to implement a convolutional neural network.\n",
        "You will be asked to implement 3 functions. You should give back those three functions in a file named `message_passing.py`. These functions will then be automatically tested. So be sure to respect the function signature and the function name.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assumptions\n",
        "\n",
        "To make the implementation easier we will make some assumptions:\n",
        "- the input is a single image (batch size of 1) of size 'C x H x W'\n",
        "- the convolution will be a 5x5 kernel with stride 1 and padding 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may also assume that the Conv2D layer has no bias but it will be slightly penalized in the grading.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bonus points will be given if you can handle the cases that are not covered by those assumptions.\n",

This may include a pre-processing step to transform the image into a graph and then a post-processing step to transform the graph back into an image.
